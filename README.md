### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year Computer Science student at EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University and work as a Cloud Engineer Intern at Bosch Hungary. I am always looking for where can I improve, and give my all to the challenges I face. I like working in a team and sharing my knowledge with others. My hobbies include trying new technologies, wall climbing, exercising, and hanging out with others.
